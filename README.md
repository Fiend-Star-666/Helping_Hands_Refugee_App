# 🚀 Project: Helping Hands 💖

Helping Hands was born out of a dynamic hackathon, with several skilled developers contributing to its initial creation. However, this version represents a significant transformation carried out solely by me, breathing fresh life into the project and greatly enhancing its capabilities.

## 🛠 Technology Stack 

Here's the robust tech stack that powers Helping Hands:

- **Front-end:** Beautiful user interfaces and seamless user experiences are crafted with React.JS, complemented by CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
- **Back-end:** The behind-the-scenes operations are handled by Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Spring Security. Hibernate is in charge of ORM, with MySQL supporting as the robust database.
- **Security:** For ensuring a secure environment, JWT of Spring Security oversees both authentication and authorization.

## 🌐 Project Overview

Responding to the Ukrainian crisis, "Helping Hands" 👐 was developed with a noble purpose - to ease the burdens of the displaced. This platform acts as a bridge 🌉, connecting volunteers to refugees in need of assistance for various tasks.

### 👥 User Workflow

Upon creating an account, users can identify as a volunteer 🦸 or a refugee 🏠. Refugees can list tasks they need assistance with, and volunteers can accept and complete these tasks. As a token of appreciation, volunteers earn points 🎖️, which they can redeem for rewards later! Additionally, volunteers can offer different types of services for refugees.

### 📂 Repository Structure

This repository contains both front-end and back-end code.

#### 🔧 Back-end Instructions

For the back-end setup, install the Lombok library. Don't forget to update the application.properties file with your local MySQL setup's link.

#### 🎨 Front-end Instructions

To set up the front-end, navigate to the project directory, and run `npm install`.

Kickstart the app with `npm start`. You can now access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3001) in your browser. The page auto-refreshes with any edits made, and any lint errors will be flagged in the console.

Enjoy exploring Helping Hands! 🎉
